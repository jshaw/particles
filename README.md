# Particle experiment
this is basically an ongoing exploration on particle systems I'm doing. I'll add a new experiment every now and then when I got an idea… Since this is leaning by doing, the code is not optimized in any way. I always try to write human readable and easy understandable code, though. If you have a suggestion and/or a queston contact and fork, please…

The project is written in HTML5, CSS and Javascript and uses the canvas tag for rendering.

It uses James Coglans [Sylvester](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/ "Sylvester") library.
